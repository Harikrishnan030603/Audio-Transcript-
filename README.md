Social Media Marketing
1.	How often do you come across travel-related advertisements on your social media feeds? "I’m on social media daily mostly Facebook and Instagram. I check them in the mornings and evenings to catch up with friends and see travel-related content."
2.	What types of social media advertisements (e.g., videos, sponsored posts, stories) do you find most engaging when it comes to travel destinations? "I engage with high-quality photos, travel vlogs, and behind-the-scenes content from other influencers. I’m always on the lookout for trends and ideas that I can adapt for my own channels."
3.	Can you describe a social media marketing campaign for a travel destination that you found particularly effective? What made it stand out? "Yes, I can recall a specific social media campaign that influenced my decision to visit a destination. A while ago, I came across a campaign on Instagram that showcased the stunning beauty of Ladakh. The campaign featured captivating videos of the region’s breathtaking landscapes, including rugged mountains, serene lakes, and the vibrant culture of the local monasteries."
4.	How do you feel about personalized advertisements for travel destinations based on your browsing history or interests? "When it comes to sponsored posts or advertisements related to travel on social media, I have mixed feelings. I often find them helpful, especially when they introduce me to new destinations, travel deals, or unique experiences that I might not have discovered otherwise."
5.	How likely are you to click on a travel advertisement you see on social media? What factors influence your decision? "I’m not very likely to book a trip immediately after seeing a destination marketed on social media. While social media can inspire me and help me identify potential places to visit, I prefer to take the time to do thorough research and plan my trip carefully."

   
Influencer Marketing
1.	Do you follow any travel influencers on social media? If so, who are your favourites and why? "Yes, I follow travel influencers, especially those who share authentic and adventurous content. I trust their recommendations more than traditional ads because they often provide a more personal and relatable perspective."
2.	How much do travel influencers impact your decisions when choosing a travel destination? "Influencers play a significant role, especially those who share authentic and adventurous content. I trust their recommendations more than traditional ads because they often provide a more personal and relatable perspective."
3.	Can you recall a specific instance where a travel influencer inspired you to visit a destination? What about their content influenced you? "Yes, I was deeply influenced by an Instagram campaign that documented a road trip through Patagonia. The raw beauty and sense of adventure it portrayed convinced me to add it to my travel bucket list."
4.	How important is the authenticity of a travel influencer to you? How do you judge whether an influencer is genuine or just promoting for sponsorship? "Authenticity is crucial. I look for influencers who provide honest reviews and share real experiences. If their content feels staged or overly promotional, I’m less likely to trust them."
5.	What types of influencer content (e.g., travel vlogs, destination reviews, day-in-the-life videos) do you find most persuasive? "I engage with travel vlogs and destination reviews that showcase authentic experiences, especially those involving adventure and cultural immersion."


Destination Marketing
1.	How do you typically find new travel destinations to visit? What role does social media play in this process? "Social media definitely helps me discover new places and get ideas. It’s not the only factor, but it helps me narrow down my choices and get excited about potential destinations."
2.	What kind of social media content from destination marketing organizations (e.g., tourism boards, travel agencies) do you find most useful? "I find high-quality visuals, travel vlogs, and detailed travel guides particularly useful. Content that showcases unique aspects of a destination and provides practical travel tips is especially valuable."
3.	How do social media marketing efforts by travel destinations compare to traditional marketing methods (e.g., TV ads, print media) in terms of effectiveness? "Social media marketing often feels more personal and engaging compared to traditional ads. I find it more relatable when influencers or real travelers share their experiences rather than seeing a polished commercial."
4.	Have you ever visited a destination based solely on its social media marketing? What elements of the campaign convinced you to visit? "Yes, I’ve planned trips based on what I saw on social media. For example, I decided to visit Iceland after seeing a series of breathtaking photos and videos on Instagram. The landscapes looked so surreal, and seeing other solo travelers share their experiences gave me the confidence to plan my own trip there."
5.	How important are user-generated content and reviews on social media in shaping your perception of a travel destination? "User-generated content is very important. It feels more authentic and gives a better sense of what the destination is really like. I often rely on reviews and real experiences shared by other travelers."
6.	Is there anything else you’d like to share about your experiences with social media, influencer marketing, and travel destinations? "Social media has been an incredible tool for discovering new places and experiences. However, it’s important to approach it with a critical eye, ensuring that the content is genuine and aligns with what I’m looking for in a travel experience."
